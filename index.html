     <h2>	&#9660; My place of residence &#9660;</h2>
     <p>
       I was born and live in Polonne.<br>
       This is a small town in the Khmelnytsky region.<br>
       It has everything you need for a comfortable stay.<br>
       Various cafes, restaurants, shops, kiosks allow you to buy anything,<br>
       but the main place of the city is the<em><b> market</b></em>.

          which site using the parallax effect I made.<br>
       Although it is as simple as possible,<br>
        but there is a clear principle of the parallax effect.</p>
